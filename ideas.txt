Ideas for what else to do:
allow ratings for each food thing, give an overall rating to each foodplace.
List foods by meal, or by rating given to them.
Calendar option?
Make it look prettier in general.
Do some preview of each place on the home page.
calorie count on the other side?

what I want to do:
review page has a form. This form takes in the food eaten, hall name, and a review from 0-10. The standard review before update should be 0 for all food.

gotta make sure that when same food is added, that food is not regiven a review of 0.
