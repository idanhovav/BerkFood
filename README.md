This is a website that tracks what food will be served at each of UC Berkeley's
dining halls for that day. 

A rating system is on the way so that recommendations can be given by the 
website on which dining hall to dine at.

This project was begun in the Practical Programming DeCal available at UC
Berkeley. Starter code was received from the instructor of the course, Sumukh
S. The rest was coded by myself, Idan Hovav.
